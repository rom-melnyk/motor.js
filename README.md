# Motor, the data flow framework

## Idea

Data flow is usually linear, for instance,

1. _retrieve_ data from the input field,
1. _validate_ the data,
1. TBD

Even asynchronous activities lead to linear expectations.

## Development

#### Running the demo page
* `npm install -g instant-server`
* run instant in `demo/` and you'll be able to run the demo page

#### Developing
* run `npm run dev`; that automatically compiles all the source files once you edit any
